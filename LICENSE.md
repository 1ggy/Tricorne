Unicorns and Kitten Farts License

The terms of this license are derived from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philsturgeon/dbad/master/LICENSE-en.md

1. Do whatever you like with the original intellectual property, just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

	 1a. Outright intellectual property (IP) infringement. Don't just copy this and change the name.
	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever.
	 1c. Modifying the original IP to contain hidden harmful content or otherwise breaking the IP.
   1d. Modifying the original IP and attempting to protect it via copyright or patents.  If this helps you, pay it forward.  Leave it open and free.

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original IP, share the love.

 3. IP is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's IP, whether it's geometry or code or kittens, and bitching when it goes wrong is silly. Fix the problem yourself. Submit the fix back.
